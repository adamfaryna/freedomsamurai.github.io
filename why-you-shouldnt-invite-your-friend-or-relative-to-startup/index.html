Sometimes it was ridiculously funny, sometimes it was painful.</p><p>As you probably know, in startups world, there are no easy tasks. Everything is hard, you do everything first time, everything is new.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Finding startup founder is not easy task.</p><p>If you are looking for a founder or have a good friend you want to invite to you business, you may find some nuggets in my experiences shared in this post.</p><p>When as a startup founder I started looking for co-founders, employees or other business partners, I soon realise why “finding right people” and convince to work with us or for us is so hard task. I believe being attractive as startup founder is a wisdom in action. It’s a lifestyle, which tells valuable people that we earn the right to be listened and give us a try. People like Steve Jobs had mastered this skill. This is one of the reasons, why as a startup or other kind of business founders we cannot be impressed enough with his results.</p><p>Looking for co-founders among friends is not the best idea. Unless you have many friends and some of them have valuable skills and right attitude towards business, you probably delude ourself that our best fishing, soccer, darts or hiking buddy will be your perfect startup founder.</p><p>But don’t get me wrong, it’s still possible they can be great co-founder, if they can put something on the table, don’t neglect them without second look.</p><p>If you want verify if he can be good material, rather than just inviting him to the startup right on the spot, try to do some project on the side with him and let see how it will go. Of course, when you have a great startup idea and you want to make it happen as soon as possible it sounds daunting to spend time on doing things that sounds irrelevant, but In practice it can save you a lot of time, frustrations, potentially save your friendship and family relationships (if you think about bringing your family member to the business), if you could avoid situation when you have to part ways with him or her.</p><p>One day, my and my brother friend share with us business idea and invited us to do it together. The plan was simple, let’s build an app and website for people with allergies for gluten to help them easily find restaurants and grocery shops when they can buy safe meals, especially when they are visiting new cities. It was great idea. Our friend and her friend, because of their allergies (one of them had celiac, the other one felt sick after small amount of gluten) were great partners candidates, they already know the domain and typical problems of our users. So we become startup of four, 2 technical geeks responsible for tech and strategic planning and 2 domain experts responsible for marketing, building community and setting partnerships.</p><p>We decided that, me and my brother will build app and website, when the girls will do research, ‘infiltrate’ and build relationships in related online and offline communities.</p><p>I want to emphasize here that me, my brother and our female friend, were really good friends back than. We were spending weekends together, parting, hiking through the mountains, having shared friends and so on. But when me and my brother realised the girls were only piggybacking, they don’t really know the domain and don’t provide the value they promise, we decided to “gently” part ways, but there was a problem.</p><p>The idea wasn’t ours and the girls felt deceived. We tried to logically explain the situation, that to make this project successful it requires hard work from everyone, and we all have to do whatever it takes, and they are very behind, which their skills and engagement. The mentality “the idea is gold itself” was to strong for them, though.</p><p>Our friendship falls apart, and we don’t speak which each other to this day. Lesson learned, hard way.</p><p>Eventually the girls were overboard, so me and my brother decided to continue building app and doing business. We both have technical skills and I spend years learning about marketing and startups, so it should be a home run.</p><p>We bought beautiful new flip chart, and we spend next week planning our business venture from scratch.</p><p>The blueprint and the plan looks great, but when we started implementing something weird started to happen.</p><p>To give you a context, me and my brother have grown up together. As kids, we used to share first computer among other things - back than we were only playing games. But almost every venture that we started together used to fall apart. It’s not because of lack of any skills, but our egos. It was just too hard for us to make decisions about things and share work. Somehow the bad emotions from the past always start to arise and even small discussion was quickly turned into battle, and to war eventually. When we tried to keep it going after two intense argues, we eventually decided to quit working together, because as we concluded “it’s somehow impossible for us to work together”.</p><p>Of course after we quit our partnership our sibling relationship was recovered, but we probably will never try again, just to keep our relationship in good shape.</p><p>On paper everything looks great, everyone who heard we finally started working on app together was optimistic about the outcomes. But we just not meant to build business together, and we have to just move on.</p><p>There are many other stories that I want to share - especially the one I had recently - but this post is already long enough so let’s keep it for another post.</p><p>Do you have any good or bad experiences doing ventures with your friends or family members?
