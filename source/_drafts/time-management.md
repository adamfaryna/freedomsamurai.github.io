At the beggining of new year you probably put a lot of things to be done on your table?

If so, than great. Now it's time to start checking these list bit by bit to finish this year
which cheer smile on your face that you have made it.

Nobody said it's going to be easy, it not that hard to find people who didn't make it
because one of hundred possible reasons. You don't have quarantee you will succeed as well
but without having smart game plan you planning to fail. (as Jim Rohn said)

I learned a lot about setting goals from my mentors through the years, Jim Rohn, Brian Tracy, Tony Robins, Zig Zigglar and many others.

We have only 24h durring the day, nothing more and nothing less. We wake up and another 24h is ready to be spend, it's really miracle. Time is the most precious resource we have on our disposal, it's really our lifes at hand.

It's the same 24h for everyone, it doesn't matter if we are millionaires or homeless people, we have the same amount of time. The only thing we can do is to put more in the hours.

Have you tried to go back and think about your days? What you actually do durring the days? How much time it takes you? How much time you spend on preparing meals, eating, commuting etc. How can you optimise this? Spend less time on these things and have similar results?
How can you stop doing these things at all and have similar results, or delegate them to
someone who will do the same just good enough?

Let's assume that on your goal list you have:
- loose 10kg
- write 5 blog posts
- learn Japanese to the point to understand kana charsets and to do small talk with Japanese people
- find suitable investing strategy (which fullify requirement X) and invest Y amount of money
- learn new programming language by creating first web application and publishing it online
become better communicator (listen more, talk less for 30 day)

I know, these are very generic goals, for every of them we need measure that will indifinetly let us know if we reach the particular goal or not.

Here is the list I found I used to waste the most time:
