There are dozen of reasons why startups fail, but from my experience there are only real two.

<!-- more -->

1. Partner sucks

Wrong partner
not commited enough
no accauntability, no real progress
it's no priority for them
duck try to get to eagle school
they just want someone to build app for them for free
no trust



2. honesty



2. Organisation sucks

no plan of action
no deadlines for tasks

3. Marketing sucks

This can be material for another 10 long blog posts, so let's just scratch the surface.

no marketing
no marketing plan
ignorance about market needs
no idea about real numbers (how much clients are already spending for these kind of services)
no relationship building but hidding

4. Development sucks
