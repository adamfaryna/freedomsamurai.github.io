When we decide we need startup founder. If you still don't sure if you need co-founder for your business, the other post I wrote can help you make up your mind [blog post](https://freedomsamurai.com).

As you probably know, in startups world, there are no easy tasks. Everything is hard, everything is new.

finding startup founder is not easy task.

If you are looking for a founder or have a good friend you want to invite to you business, you will find some nuggets in my experiences shared in this post.

When as a startup founder started looking for co-founders, employees or other business partners, I soon realise why "finding right people" and convincing to work for you or with you is so hard task. I believe this is a skill, but probably also a talent as well, which people like Steve Jobs had and as a startup or other kind of business founder we cannot be impressed enough.

1. He is not our friend

Looking for co-founders in our already friends environment is not good idea. It possible that somebody is great fishing, soccer, darts or hiking buddy, but he/she can be terrible as a startup founder.

But it's still possible they could be great co-founder, so don't neglect them.

If you want verify if he can be good material. Rather than just inviting him to the startup from the spot, try to do some project on the side with him and let see how it will go.

I found this very important lesson when me, my brother Martin and our friend Michael, very building startup "Zebra". Service which delivers "qr codes" labeling to museums and public places of interests, which dedicated application and website.

Me and my brother were both technical and Michael was responsible for generating leads and sales. And to be honest he was really good at this.

Even though Michael was one of my best friend back than, I couldn't get along together to work with my brother.

We managed to build MVP, prepare presentation and successfuly pitch to decision makers in big museums in Warsaw Poland, but we had faild eventualy. Couple of years later some other woman does this business and earn millions. Lesson learned.

Of course not only our business fail, but my relationship with Michael and my brother get injured as well.

Couple months later, one of my and my brother friends share with us another business idea and invited us to do it together. The plan was to build an app and website for people with gluten alergies to make them easy to find restaurants and grocery shops when they can buy meals. It was great idea and our friend and her friend, because of their allergies (one of them had coeliac) was a great first user for final product.

We decided that, me and my brother will build app and website, when the girls will do research, "infiltrate" and build relationships in related online and offline communities.

I want to emphasize here that me, my brother and our female friend, were really good friends back than. We were spending weekends together, parting, having shared friends. As you can imagine after our hard conversation, our friendship fall apart and we don't speak which each other to this day. Another lesson learned, hard way.

my and my brother have another business ideas and we though that we did it wrong last time but now we know how to handle each other. Actually we though, it was because Michael was to overwhelming for us, that we agreed that it was probably his thought that the business had failed. So we decided to try again one more time.

We bought beautiful new flipchart and for a week we were planning our next business.

The same pattern repeated for me couple times in the future, the results was exactly the same as at first time.
