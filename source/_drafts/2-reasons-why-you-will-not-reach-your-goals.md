To be hones I struggled which this for years. I always found great reason to delay important things for another
5 min, 10 minutes, an hour, a week... forever.

Back than, 7 years ago, when I first discovered inspiring, self development books and biographies of successful
people I commited myself to change my life for better, at least I thought I was commmited. But the truth is
I didn't know, how much hard work it takes to make any progress, actually what it is to "work hard" and not
lie to myself. The first real step for me was to find the real meaning about crucial phrases that these
successfull people were talking about, I had to start doing an effort, blindly believing it will bring me somewhere
from this hole I was living in. This experience was important and gives me foundation to start believing in myself
that actually I can be successful, I'm not as misserable as everyone around (including closest realives, almost
without exceptions) tried to instil in me. Slowly but stadly I started gaining confidence and asking the universe
(setting goals) for more, and by doing hard work getting more results in return and start having even more bold
goals.

At this day, having all experience I gathered in my 37 years I'm stepping on this earth my goals become much
more ambitious than I could ever imagine. I don't feel overwhelmed by them but excited. I don't feel they are
imposible because I already meet people who achieve similar goals and more having less resources than I have.
I'm aware there are no good exceauses not to reach them as well, and I have vision that not achieving them
will be match more painfull than hard work to make them happen (taking it from Tony Robbins).

So lets assume you already have ambitious list of goals that you want to reach this week, month or maybe even year.
I planning my entire years these days and try to adapt my monthly, weekly and daily activities to reach these goals.
I found following

1. Short term goals will not motivate you

They only reason is to help you achieve long term goals, which are where the real gold is.

2. Long term goals is the answer


The two most common problems with setting game plan for long term goals I discovered is people are too optimisting about
how much they could achieve or too little optimistic (they don't really believe they can achieve long term goals
at first place).

I was a victim of it as well, of both of these issues.
