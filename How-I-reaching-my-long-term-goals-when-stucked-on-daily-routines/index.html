But every day we have to deal with some time-wasting activities or far from optimal processes (and people) that will waste all our time and energy if we are not ready to handle them.</p><p>Here are some basic time management strategies that I use to get the most of the day and reach my goals as planned.</p><a id="more"></a><p>If your 2019 is loaded with goals as my you can find it useful.</p><h2 id="Waiting-in-the-queue"><a href="#Waiting-in-the-queue" class="headerlink" title="Waiting in the queue"></a>Waiting in the queue</h2><p>When waiting in a queue in the grocery, fashion store, doctor etc. I used to do the same things what other people around, nothing.</p><p>The solution was getting all the books, articles, messages to be available to read from my smartphone, so even if the queue is moving slowly I waste no time.</p><p>For me to stay in the queue is not problem any more. During this couple of minutes I can read couple pages of the book I digest or go through couple of articles.</p><p>If doing grocery shopping, taking your clothes to dry cleaner or similar activities, took you a lot of time, maybe you should consider delegating it.</p><p>Ordering groceries online become easily available in big cities these days. They are also services like dry cleaners who will come to your home and take dirty things and bring them back fresh and clean, the same or next day.</p><p>These days for being productive when stating in the queues I use these smartphone apps:</p><ul><li><a href="https://getpocket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pocket</a> (for making web articles available offline from any device)</li><li>Kindle, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader&hl=en_GB (first one take care about mobi files, M+R take care about any other ebook formats and allows adding marks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moon+ Reader</a></li><li>Gmail (manage multiple gmail accounts)</li><li><a href="https://www.wunderlist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wunderlist</a> (everything that can be listed I keep here)</li><li><a href="http://www.orgzly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orgzly</a> (make my Emacs org files available on smartphone - my knowledge base) (Yes, I’m proud Emacs user)</li><li><a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trello</a> (let me manage task list from anywhere)</li><li><a href="https://citymapper.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citymapper</a> & <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a> (let me plan commutes)</li><li>Calendar (let me add/edit/delete events)</li></ul><h2 id="Commuting-Travelling"><a href="#Commuting-Travelling" class="headerlink" title="Commuting / Travelling"></a>Commuting / Travelling</h2><p>Another huge time waster, but there are some options to solve this issue.</p><p>What I do:</p><ul><li>use apps from point 1) to go through the content I have to read, I review my notes and daily plans</li><li>if online, I use apps from point 1) to communicate with rest of the team and rest of the world</li><li>use taxi-like services to do the work from the back seat and let by driven to destination in good style - magic!</li><li>listen to audiobooks, podcasts, watch tutorials/seminars about topics related to your goals</li><li>do the work remotely</li><li>don’t commute at all, unless it’s a must</li></ul><p>If you have a boss and you can work remotely, build a reputation that it’s what makes you the most productive, so you should have more remote days available.</p><h2 id="Preparing-meals"><a href="#Preparing-meals" class="headerlink" title="Preparing meals"></a>Preparing meals</h2><p>You can be surprise how much time it could consume. If we don’t settle for ready-to-eat microwave food, this could cost us a lot of time as long as we don’t have system at place.</p><p>Cook yourself, big portions at once that you can eat part now and put rest into freezer for following days.</p><p>I do cook myself a lot, big portions but simple meals. Some meals are full of nutritions, and they are easy to prepare at the same time. You can make them in minutes and feel good after. You can get some inspiration from this simple food catalogue I created <a href="https://notimeforcooking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notimeforcooking.com</a>.</p><p>Another option is to delegate it, by simply not being involved in preparing meals but only consuming them. For this you can order food online from the restaurants or use meals delivery services like uber eats or deliveroo.</p><p>If eating healthy, organic food is important for you, you can subscribe to service like X. They will bring organic food to your home regularly.</p><p>Another option is to have someone prepare meals for you. If you have girlfriend or boyfriend you can negotiate with them if they can prepare some meals during the day and you will do something in return. If you live close to your mother or grandmother, you can ask them for help. Maybe they would be eager to cook something for you from time to time, so you save precious tens of minutes.</p><p>Of course, it depends on how your relations look like, but it’s worth mention that our parents more often than not are eager to help us. If you follow this strategy, keep in mind to do something for them in return to make them feel good as well.</p><h2 id="Communicating-with-other-people"><a href="#Communicating-with-other-people" class="headerlink" title="Communicating with other people"></a>Communicating with other people</h2><p>This could be great time waster. Some people prefer to jump over Skype or phone call, when the issue could be resolved with single sentence message. Many people overload their communication as well, by not addressing the issue or by using 100 words when less than 10 would be sufficient. Ask me, I used to work with these kinds of people.</p><p>Being simple, brief communicator is a skill, but sadly many people neglect its worth, but as long as you know that it’s important to just find out what the issue is, by using the least amounts of words, but not less, you can moderate the messaging channel and strive to the point.</p><p>Couple of ideas that helped me save time, when communicating with other people:</p><ul><li>make it clear what’s the point of the call before call (prepare agenda)</li><li>try to get to the merit from the flood of worlds as fast as possible, verbalise it to confirm and lead to solution propose phase</li><li>if the text message doesn’t sound important, wait before replying for 30 minutes, sometimes the issue will resolve itself</li><li>be brief, the simpler the language and the shorter your message the better (be brief but verbose enough)</li><li>unless your position demands opposite, reply to the emails no more than twice a day. Turn off instant incoming notifications.</li><li>don’t get involved in pointless complain or unrelated off topics, just ignore these messages</li></ul><h2 id="Physical-training"><a href="#Physical-training" class="headerlink" title="Physical training"></a>Physical training</h2><h3 id="When-working-at-the-office"><a href="#When-working-at-the-office" class="headerlink" title="When working at the office"></a>When working at the office</h3><p>It used to happen more and more often that gym or jogging is available not only for people working remotely. Gyms have started being opening to work offices these days so the only issue could be to find time. Speak with your colleagues, maybe attending gym classes in the middle of the day is something that is normal in your working environment. If you found opposite, speak with your manager how important healthy living is for you, and it helps keep your brain powers sharp and being more productive. If he/she is not flexible, negotiate to go to the gym during lunch break and have a lunch afterwards when working at the same time. If the conversation works well, ask if company would sponsor your gym classes. There is a chance they can provide it for you. It’s worth to try.</p><h3 id="When-working-remotely"><a href="#When-working-remotely" class="headerlink" title="When working remotely"></a>When working remotely</h3><p>In this situation, you probably have total freedom to organise your fitness activities every single day. The only issue could be how to make it time efficient.</p><p>Here are some ideas that can help you:</p><ul><li>have a weekly training plan adapted to your around work availability</li><li>maybe you can cut off some commuting time, by buying weights and training at home at least some parts of body</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>That’s it. There are many tools and strategies that we can adapt to make big savings in our time spend. There are always opportunities for improvements in the way we manage our time, so the best strategy from my experience is to always look for better ways to do things.</p><p>It’s important to remember that if we stop being interested in this, the time wasters will start ruling, they always lurk around.</p><p>Every garden must be tended or the weeds will take it over. (paraphrasing my mentor Jim Rohn)</p><p>What’s yours time saver advices?
